### Not Complete
I unfortunately ran out of time. I continued to work on last weeks challenge through much of this week, which in turn pushed my classwork later, which meant I started this with only hours to spare and ran out of time. Beyond that I was having extensive trouble getting JavaScript to wait for user input before continuing a for loop, an issue I'm going to be delving into asap. This program is mostly non-functional. likely to be a dropped grade unless I stupidly manage to let things slip again.
